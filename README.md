# Demo Dating Website – Security Awareness Project

This project is a demo dating website developed for educational purposes to demonstrate common web security vulnerabilities. The application simulates how user details and uploaded photos can be captured during login and signup when proper security measures are not implemented. A “hacked” message is displayed to highlight the potential risks of insecure authentication and data handling.

## Project Objective

- User signup and login functionality  
- Captures user details and profile images  
- Demonstrates insecure data handling  
- Displays a hacked message to simulate a security breach  
- Simple UI for demonstration and testing
